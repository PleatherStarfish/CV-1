I am an enthusiastic Junior Developer with the business acumen, communication and delivery skills of a seasoned Management Consultant. I pride myself on software craftsmanship and I am driven by learning.

Following 4 years as a Strategy & Operations Consultant at Deloitte, I won the Makers Academy & ETC Coding Competition. In the intensive 16 week bootcamp that followed, I loved coding in an environment where the focus was honing a best-practice approach to development.

I want to work as part of a dynamic team to learn, solve difficult challenges and build cutting-edge digital technology.

------------------------------------

I am an analytical Strategy and Operations management consultant at Deloitte, who's unique skillset is an ability to rapidly learn and apply new technical skills and knowledge whilst establishing meaningful relationships as a trusted part of a team and advisor to my clients.

As a consultant I independently lead and delivered work streams in international consulting deployments in London, Brazil, Holland and Belgium for over 15 global multinationals; analysed, visualised, presented and actioned findings for 300m+ lines of data using VBA, SQL, Tableau and Qlikview; delivered presentations to groups of 30+ people in hedge funds to FTSE 100 companies and automated business processes at FTSE 100 companies by working with developers using SQL, VBA and Blue Prism.

#### Technical and Analytical

My work In Deloitte's consulting practice has been defined by the technical and analytical edge I have rapidly developed and delivered upon in my client engagements. I am unique in my operating unit in having delivered engagements by using/managing others in using a broad range of technical tools (VBA, SQL, Tableau, Qlikview and Blue Prism).

I have used these skills to deliver analytics and automation projects at some of the world's largest companies. At a Global top 10 consumer business company, I self-taught SQL in order to prove to the team we needed to use it to succeed; and then went on to manage 2 SQL developers and client stakeholders in analysing over 100 million rows of data whilst simultaneously building a leading-edge data visualisation model in Qlikview - leading to the identification and delivery phase of Â£200m+ in working capital opportunities. At a Global top 10 pharmaceutical company, I went from having never seen code to co-developing a tool in excel VBA that turned a 5 day data preparation process that included inputs and work from 8 people into one button click.


#### Delivering complex projects

As a consultant I independently lead and delivered work streams in international consulting deployments in London, Brazil, Holland and Belgium for over 15 global multinationals.

Most recently, I delivered the South America work stream for a complex operations change project at a FTSE 100 company. I managed and delivered the work stream end-to-end as the point of contact for all stakeholders (including the client lead); creating and delivering content for 12 workshops; facilitating 3 training courses and conducting all aspects of project planning and delivery.

#### Relationships and teamwork

Consistently, the brightest points of my working day are the breakthrough moments I have in my relationships with the people I work with. In terms of my personal growth, the central theme has been the mentors I have had and the people I have been lucky enough to mentor: they have helped me think differently, perform as my best self and ultimately be myself.

At Deloitte I took great pride in learning and then demystifying analytical and technical skills for colleagues and clients. I led the development and delivery of the Strategy & Operations Analytics Bootcamp to over 200 consultants.
