## Marcus Gardiner

I am an analytical Strategy and Operations management consultant at Deloitte, who's unique skillset is an ability to rapidly learn and apply new technical skills and knowledge whilst establishing meaningful relationships as a trusted part of a team and advisor to my clients. 

I have independently lead and delivered work streams in international consulting deployments in London, Brazil, Holland and Belgium (and have worked at 15+ global multinationals); analysed, visualised, presented and actioned findings for 300m+ lines of data using VBA, SQL, Tableau and Qlikview; delivered presentations to groups of 30+ people in hedge funds to FTSE 100 companies and automated business processes at FTSE 100 companies by working with developers using SQL, VBA and Blue Prism. 

I have directed my career based on a growing interest in technological skills and am keen to pursue my own technical development as a developer - I want to spend more of my time building and using a technical and team-orientated set of strengths to solve difficult logical challenges and be a part of shaping and building what is technologically possible. 

## Skills

#### Technical and Analytical

My work In Deloitte's consulting practice has been defined by the technical and analytical edge I have rapidly developed and delivered upon in my client engagements. I am unique in my operating unit in having delivered engagements by using/managing others in using a broad range of technical tools (VBA, SQL, Tableau, Qlikview and Blue Prism). 

I have used these skills to deliver analytics and automation projects at some of the world's largest companies. At a Global top 10 consumer business company, I self-taught SQL in order to prove to the team we needed to use it to succeed; and then went on to manage SQL developers and client stakeholders in analysing over 100 million rows of data whilst personally building a leading-edge data visualisation model to present the results in Qlikview - leading to the identification and delivery phase of Â£200m+ in working capital opportunities. At a Global top 10 pharmaceutical company, I went from having never seen code to co-developing a tool in excel VBA that turned a 5 day data preparation process that included inputs and work from 8 people into one button click. 


#### Delivering complex projects

I have a breadth of experience in rapidly delivering complex and impactful projects at over 15 global multinationals across the Consumer Business, Manufacturing and Healthcare Life Sciences industries. In doing so, I have taken end-to-end ownership of work streams, for which I have leveraged my analytical and technical skills, managed up to 3 others and planned and delivered numerous workshops, presentations and training courses.

Most recently, I independently lead and delivered the South America work stream for a complex operations change project at a FTSE 100 company. I managed and delivered the work stream end-to-end, including being the point of contact for local stakeholders (including the GM and client lead); creating and delivering content for 12 workshops; facilitating 3 training courses and conducting all aspects of project planning and management.

#### Relationships and teamwork

Consistently, the brightest points of my working day are the breakthrough moments I have in my relationships with the people I work with and my clients. In terms of my development in my career, the central theme has been the mentors I have had and the people I have been lucky enough to mentor: they have helped me think differently, perform as my best self and ultimately be myself at work. 

I have always tried to follow what I have been most interested at work, so being part of a team and helping it develop and deliver has been of great importance to me. I take great pride in demystifying analytical and technical skills for colleagues and working with others to apply them. As a result I am currently developing and facilitating Analytics 'Crash Course' Bootcamps and Agile delivery training courses for Deloitte Strategy and Operations.
